**intronProspector** â€” Extract putative junctions from RNA-Seq alignments

SYNOPSIS
========

`intronProspector [options] [readaligns]`

DESCRIPTION
===========

Find putative intron junctions in a RNA-Seq alignment. The *readaligns* file maybe in SAM, BAM, or CRAM format and does not need to be sorted or indexed and maybe streamed. If omitted, stdin is used.

This program allows for calling splice junctions indebtedness of the alignment program.  It maybe used in a pipeline, copying the alignment file on `stdin` to `stdout`.  It can sit between an aligner outputting SAM and `samtools` to convert to BAM/CRAM.

Options
-------

`-h, --help`

> Prints brief usage information.

`-v, --version`

> Prints the current version number.

`-a INT, --min-anchor-length=INT`

> Minimum anchor length. Junctions which satisfy a minimum anchor length on both sides are reported.  Mismatch bases don't count towards the meeting this threshold.  The default is 8 bases.

`-i INT, --min-intron_length=INT`

> Minimum intron length. The default is 70 bases.

`-I INT,  --max-intron_length=INT`

> Maximum intron length. The default is 500000 bases.

`-s STRING, --strandness=STRING`

> Strand specificity of RNA library preparation.  Use `UN` for unstranded, `RF` for first-strand, `FR` for second-strand (case-insensitive).  The default is `UN`.  This is used to set the strand in the junction-format BED file.

`-U, --map-to-ucsc`
> Naively generate UCSC chromosome names in TSV and BED files.  This pre-pends `chr` to numeric and X/Y names and change `MT` to `chrMT`, other name are not modified.  This will not produce the correct results for other sequences such as alts, patches, and unmapped sequences.  It does not modify records passed through (-p).

`-c FILE, --intron-calls=FILE`

> Write a tab-separated values (TSV) file, with the junctions calls.  It will contain the following columns :
* chrom - chromosome name
* intron_start - zero based starting coordinates of intron.
* intron_end - zero based ending coordinates of intron.
* strand - `+`, `-`, or `.` if not known.
* uniq_mapped_count - number of uniquely mapped reads supporting the junction.
* multi_mapped_count - number of uniquely mapped reads supporting the junction.
* unsure_mapped_count - number of reads that are either in discordant or partial mapped pair or do not have the BAM `NH` tag.
* max_left_overhang - maximum number of bases overlapping the exon upstream of the intron.
* max_right_overhang - maximum number of bases overlapping the exon downstream of the intron.

`-j FILE, --junction-bed=FILE`

> Write the junction calls and support anchors to this file.  This is in the same format as ToHat `junctions.bed` and `regtools junction extract` output.  It UCSC BED track, with each junction consists of two connected BED blocks, where each block is as long as the maximal overhang of any read spanning the junction. The score is the number of alignments spanning the junction, with a maximum score of 1000 for UCSC browser compatibility.

`-n FILE, --intron-bed=FILE`

> Write the intron BED with the bounds of the intron. The score is the number of alignments spanning the junction, with a maximum score of 1000 for UCSC browser compatibility.

`-p FILE, --pass-through=FILE`

> Pass through input BAM/SAM records to this file, used for constructing pipelines with `/dev/stdin` is specified.  CRAM output is not support, these will be written as BAM.

EXAMPLES
========

Call junctions from a BAM file, also creating BEDs of junctions and introns:
```
intronProspector --intron-calls=introns.tsv --junction-bed=juncs.bed --intron-bed=introns.bed reads.bam
```

Pipeline to call introns and create a CRAM file:
```
cat reads.sam \
    | samtools sort -O sam  \
    | ./intronProspector -c introns.tsv -p /dev/stdout \
    | samtools view -O CRAM -T grch38.fa >reads.cram
```
Note that the `cat` command could be an aligner output a SAM file and that the genome FASTA file must be index by `samtools faidx`.
