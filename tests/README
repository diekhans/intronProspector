Test cases:
  - test_basic:
    test_basic.sam extracted from ERR315432 for a couple of regions on GRCh38,
    including multi-mappers.  For reference, the STAR SJ calls from this
    region are in input/test_basic.star.sj.tab


 - fake10:
   fake10 consists of the GRCh38 chr10 region of ERR315432 from test_basic,
   with the reads in test_basic extract from the fastq. These mapped
   with STAR and hisat2, creating the test sam files.  Only the sam
   files are used in the test, the input files are there to update or
   reuse.
