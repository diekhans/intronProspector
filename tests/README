Test cases:
  - test_basic:
    test_basic.sam extracted from ERR315432 for a couple of regions on GRCh38,
    including multi-mappers.  For reference, the STAR SJ calls from this
    region are in input/test_basic.star.sj.tab

  - test_multi
    extracted from ERR315432 with reads crossing two or three exons
    
  - fake10:
    fake10 consists of the GRCh38 chr10 region of ERR315432 from test_basic,
    with the reads in test_basic extract from the fastq. These mapped
    with STAR and hisat2, creating the test sam files.  Only the sam
    files are used in the test, the input files are there to update or
    reuse.  The STAR junctions and regtools calls are also included for
    debugging.

  - fake10_scramble_genome.fa
    fake10_genome.fa with lines after base 340,000 scrambles to have
    bad junctions.


 -  ont reads from LRGASP aligned to GRCh38
